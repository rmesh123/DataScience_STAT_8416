<h1> What is data science?</h1> 
<p class='cls'>With the advent of new data technologies the term Data science is getting popular now a days. Many people explain the term from many perspectives. Some people even tag this with so called big data. Many people try to explain data science using Venn diagrams. One of them, created by Drew Conway, has been very popular and got place in Wikipedia to describe data science. While this Venn diagram nicely portrays the skills required by data scientists, it does not define what data science is. In 2011 Dr. Cleveland, in his article “Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics”, first introduced data science as an independent discipline extending statistics. In all the explanations, the one missing piece is the data product. Taking it into consideration, we define data science as follows:</p> 

<p class='cls'>No matter how it is defined, it is agreed by all as we see in Wikipedia that it is a highly interdisciplinary field. It requires knowledge from various areas such as computing, statistics, mathematics and business.</p> 

<p id='dfn'>Data science is the art and science of transforming data into a deliverable data product.</p>

<h2>What we learnt from hw1? </h2>
	<ol>
		<li>We have done our first reproducible work</li>
		<li>When we write numerical summary of the data in text we don’t write the exact number instead write heRcode. This helps if data are changed and the new summary will be updated automatically.  </li>
		<li>When we writeRfunctions we have to be very specific what data type that function would take as anargument. We need to know our function to use it appropriately.</li>
		<li>To maintain the reproducibility, specify the seed when we want to simulate data</li>
		<li>We can generate many samples and calculate their statistics without using loops </li>
		<li>We just demonstrated and witnessed that central limit theorem works </li>
		<li> We learnt how to write math equation in our report</li>
		<li>When we plot, we don’t plot blindly. We explore the data first, we learn about the data type and wegive a smart plot command that produces useful plots. </li>
		<li>How to resize the picture in the document so that it looks cute and professional.  For exam-ple, if we desire a pdf output we would write options like{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5,fig.align='center', out.width='.4\\linewidth'}. On the other hand if we want HTML output,the resizing can be done giving options likeout.width='350px', dpi=150. </li>
		<li>For some of us, the technical issues of reproducibility was not straight forward. This happens with thedata scientists. We have to spend many hours with tiny errors or typos in the code. So, the learningis, start working on the HW from the day one. The upcoming homeworks may be time consuming.</li>
